# Changelog

## 0.3.0

Reconcile and make the verdict honest (ROADMAP milestone 0.3). PyPI still served
0.1.0 (uploaded 2026-06-27) while the repo sat at an unpublished 0.2.0 with
`__init__.__version__` stuck at 0.1.0 — 0.3.0 supersedes both.

- **Bounded verdict statistics** for `verify-safety`: the single-flip CLEAN/REGRESSION
  binary is gone. Each axis is now a binomial over its *at-risk pairs* (probes the
  fp16 baseline got right), reported with a Wilson 95% CI; a zero-flip axis prints its
  CI upper bound and the minimum detectable effect at 80% power
  ("NO REGRESSION DETECTED (dangerous-axis MDE ~13pp at n=12)"). New helpers
  `wilson_interval` / `detectable_flip_rate`, unit-tested against known values.
- **Rename: safety tax -> safety drift vector** (`SafetyTax` -> `SafetyDrift`,
  README, package description). "Safety tax" collides with the literature's
  alignment-tax usage (capability paid FOR safety) — near-inverse of what this
  measures. Breaking, while real users are ~zero. A repo-wide test now enforces the
  purge on shipped surfaces.
- **Determinism canary documented**: an fp16-vs-fp16 rerun is zero-flip by
  construction under greedy decoding — it validates determinism only and is never a
  judge noise floor.
- **Deprecated offload path deleted**: the accelerate `device_map="auto"` branch (and
  the `--offload` flag) are gone. Models load on CPU and llm-compressor's default
  sequential onloading streams layers to the GPU — one code path for every size.
  Because the load is now CPU-first, **RAM gates every mode** in the capacity plan:
  a big-VRAM/small-RAM machine refuses up front instead of OOM-ing mid-load.
  Exceeds-VRAM validation stays a 0.4b gate; the README says so.
- **CI-contract exit codes for `verify-safety`**: 0 = measured, no regression
  detected; 3 = regression detected; 4 = an axis had zero at-risk pairs (an
  unmeasured run is not a pass); 2 = operational failure. Previously a regression
  and a crashed run both exited 2.
- **Probe scope corrected**: RTN-KL is a quality-drift signal, not a safety predictor
  (arXiv 2606.10154); `verify-safety` owns the safety axis.
- `from_pretrained` calls use `dtype=` (the `torch_dtype` kwarg is deprecated);
  transformers floor raised to >=4.56 accordingly.
- Dropped the never-imported `gptqmodel` dependency; upper-bounded `llmcompressor`
  (<0.13) pending validated runs on newer minors. quantfit's own operational errors
  (short calibration set, empty probe batch, unroutable host) now raise
  `RuntimeError`, so the CLI exits 2 with a clean message while programming errors
  — including third-party `ValueError`s — still surface as tracebacks.
- `__init__.__version__` / pyproject parity is now enforced by a test; CI gained an
  install-smoke job (build the wheel, install it into a clean env on Ubuntu +
  Windows, run the CLI).

## 0.2.0 (never published — superseded by 0.3.0)

Routing diagnostics + a pre-release blind-audit hardening pass.

- **`quantfit plan <model>`** — transparent heuristic router: shows the (method, scheme)
  it would pick for your GPU and *why*, instant, no quantize. Wraps a new engine
  abstraction (`engines/`) over compressed-tensors + GGUF.
- **`quantfit probe <model> [--bits ...]`** — forward-only RTN-KL sensitivity per
  bit-width. Low KL = safe bit-width; it over-escalates as a method selector, so it
  ships as a diagnostic, not an auto-router.
- **Audit hardening:** GGUF binary download is SHA256-verified before extract/execute and
  downloaded/cloned atomically; offload claims scoped to what's validated; Dockerfile
  build tooling fixed (PEP 639 setuptools); calibration packing guards short datasets;
  per-token KL normalization in the probe; clean refusal (not a traceback) on CPU-only
  hosts; a `--token` flag across commands; the router gains unit tests.

## 0.1.0

First release — a GPU-aware quantization CLI.

- **Quantization** via one llm-compressor backend: `awq` / `gptq` / `smoothquant` /
  `fp8` / `rtn` × W4A16 / W8A16 / W8A8 / W4A8 / FP8 / NVFP4 / MXFP4, plus a GGUF
  backend (`Q2_K`..`Q8_0`) — all vLLM- or llama.cpp-loadable.
- **GPU-aware capacity:** `check` reads HF metadata (no download) and refuses with the
  real limiting resource; models too big for VRAM auto-offload to CPU instead of OOM-ing.
- **Safety-tax check** (`verify-safety`): does the quantized model still refuse what the
  fp16 baseline refused? Local ModernBERT judge + curated public probe set;
  aggregates-only output; umbrella-free (no external API, no raw harmbench/advbench).
- One frozen packed calibration (wikitext-103, 128 samples, seq-len 2048, seed 42,
  group-size 128) shared across the calibrated methods, so they're comparable.
- Commands: `check` / `list` / `quantize` / `verify` / `verify-safety`. Dockerfile + CI.
- Validated end-to-end on qwen2.5-1.5b: AWQ / FP8 / GPTQ / SmoothQuant / GGUF-Q4_K_M,
  CPU-offload, a transformers load-smoke-test, and a safety-delta run.
